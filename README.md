You can learn your bodytype, your ideal weight according as body type, daily calorie requirement for your body goal and your ideal body measurements by your info. Some of data coming from API, some of data calculated manually. I am planning to add membership option which will help you to track your body stats and gives you some tips! I used Tailwind for styling and Redux Toolkit for state management. It is deployed on [Netlify](https://bodygoal.tech/).
